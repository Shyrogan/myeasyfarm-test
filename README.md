# Project

Started at around 5:10pm. I realized it would have been a good idea to create a repo directly when I started to keep track of time.  
My apologies for this. I committed slightly after starting the project (there was only the welcome page on the initial commit).  
I was done at around 8:15 for the main features. Time elapsed: 3:05 (breaks included).  

You can see exact commit hours by hovering on the date of a commit (or relative time):

## Technologies used

- `tailwindcss` to avoid writing css files  
- `react-router-dom` to create routes in the application  
- `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` for the map
